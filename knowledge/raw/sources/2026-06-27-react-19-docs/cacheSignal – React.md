## cacheSignal

### React Server Components

`cacheSignal` is currently only used with [React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components).

`cacheSignal` allows you to know when the `cache()` lifetime is over.

```
const signal = cacheSignal();
```

## Reference

### cacheSignal

Call `cacheSignal` to get an `AbortSignal`.

```
import {cacheSignal} from 'react';
async function Component() {
  await fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });
}
```

When React has finished rendering, the `AbortSignal` will be aborted. This allows you to cancel any in-flight work that is no longer needed. Rendering is considered finished when:

- React has successfully completed rendering
- the render was aborted
- the render has failed

#### Parameters

This function does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns

`cacheSignal` returns an `AbortSignal` if called during rendering. Otherwise `cacheSignal()` returns `null`.

#### Caveats

- `cacheSignal` is currently for use in [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) only. In Client Components, it will always return `null`. In the future it will also be used for Client Component when a client cache refreshes or invalidates. You should not assume it’ll always be null on the client.
- If called outside of rendering, `cacheSignal` will return `null` to make it clear that the current scope isn’t cached forever.

## Usage

### Cancel in-flight requests

Call `cacheSignal` to abort in-flight requests.

```
import {cache, cacheSignal} from 'react';
const dedupedFetch = cache(fetch);
async function Component() {
cacheSignal()
}
```

### Pitfall

You can’t use `cacheSignal` to abort async work that was started outside of rendering e.g.

```
import {cacheSignal} from 'react';
// 🚩 Pitfall: The request will not actually be aborted if the rendering of \`Component\` is finished.
const response = fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });
async function Component() {
  await response;
}
```

### Ignore errors after React has finished rendering

If a function throws, it may be due to cancellation (e.g. the Database connection has been closed). You can use the `aborted` property to check if the error was due to cancellation or a real error. You may want to ignore errors that were due to cancellation.

```
import {cacheSignal} from "react";
./database

async function getData(id) {
  try {
     return await queryDatabase(id);
  } catch (x) {
cacheSignal()?.aborted
        // only log if it's a real error and not due to cancellation
       logError(x);
     }
return null
  }
}

async function Component({id}) {
  const data = await getData(id);
  if (data === null) {
    return <div>No data available</div>;
  }
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
}
```
